# Speech Recognition

 üõ† __Work In Progress__‚ùóÔ∏è

Speech recognition implemented by using __Tensorflow__ for deep learning.
We are using __recurrent neural network__ with __LSTM__ nodes and in order to deal with sequencing problem we apply __CTC__(Connectionist Temporal Classification).

## Training data
In order to train our neural network we have to download training data.
I'm using __VCTK Corpus__ which will do the trick for my purpose. If you are aiming to lower error rates I strongly recommend using more training data.  
‚ö†Ô∏è VCTK Corpus - 15GB
